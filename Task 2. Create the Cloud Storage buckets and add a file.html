In Cloud Shell, navigate to the migrate-storage directory:
cd $WORKDIR/migrate-storage

Create serving-bucket, the Cloud Storage bucket. You use this later to change storage classes:
export PROJECT_ID=$(gcloud config list --format 'value(core.project)' 2>/dev/null)
gcloud storage buckets create  gs://${PROJECT_ID}-serving-bucket -l REGION

Make the bucket public:
gsutil acl ch -u allUsers:R gs://${PROJECT_ID}-serving-bucket

Add a text file to the bucket:
gcloud storage cp $WORKDIR/migrate-storage/testfile.txt  gs://${PROJECT_ID}-serving-bucket

Make the file public:
gsutil acl ch -u allUsers:R gs://${PROJECT_ID}-serving-bucket/testfile.txt

Confirm that you’re able to access the file:
curl http://storage.googleapis.com/${PROJECT_ID}-serving-bucket/testfile.txt

Create a second bucket called idle-bucket that won’t serve any data:
gcloud storage buckets create gs://${PROJECT_ID}-idle-bucket -l REGION
export IDLE_BUCKET_NAME=$PROJECT_ID-idle-bucket
